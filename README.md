# regression_classifier_complete
This is a complete regression and classification machine learning model that will automate everything and the user will only have to input the training and testing data. 

It is still in the works, any help would be appreciated.
it is written in python 3 from scratch without the use of any machine learning libraries ( except for the feature selection algorithm )
